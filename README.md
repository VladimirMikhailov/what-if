What if better or Can I use
---

The main purpose of the project is to compare different
approaches having or not possible probabilities
in order to make any futher decision based on made experiments.

**Warning: Please, do not take experiment results so seriosly due
possible spherical horses in a vacuum during testing**

## Recommendation:

In order to give better environment overview, we highly recommend to
include into every `experiment` or `script` a basic information about
your system: OS, # of CPUs, Memory Capacity etc.

For the instence on the Mac OS X you can't get it by running from
command line tool the following line:

  `system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType SPHardwareDataType | pbcopy`

**Do not forget to remove sensitive information**
